# Credit Card Fraud Detection

- utils.py contains some functions for plotting useful in our Fraud Detection Analysis
- Fraud Detection Analysis.ipynb contains our Analysis and model for Credit Card Fraud Detection

Techniques used:
# Undersampling
- Dataset is heavily imbalanced, there are way more not fraud cases than fraud transactions

# Visualization / Outlier Detection
- Factor Analysis
- PCA

# Modeling
- Support Vector Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- 3 Layer Neural Network
- Gaussian Mixture Model (Unsupervised)

# Validation
- ROC Curve
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Scores
- Confusion Matrix (False Positive / True Negative)
